This is a clone of a subversion project I had hosted on Google Code.

I will update this README...eventually

  Sowilo is the shield of the clouds
  and shining ray
  and destroyer of ice.
  
Sowilo is the name of rune in the Elder Futhark runic alphabet. It signifies the Sun and the caster of shining rays.

This ray tracer is an extension of a student project that I created in my graduate level Advanced Computer Graphics class. However, from the outset, I wanted to create a ray tracer that had objects that moved along mathematically defined paths. So, the position of each object is determined by a parametric function of time. Additionally, the objects will also be allowed an orientation that is either itself a parametric function, or is derived from the relationship of one or more parametric trajectories. Because this project is focusing more on mathematical purity, performance is not a primary goal. However, OpenMP is used in the source code to improve running time with parallelism.
